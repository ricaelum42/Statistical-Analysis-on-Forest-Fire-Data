# Statistical-Analysis-on-Forest-Fire-Data
Winter 2018 STAT444 Final Project

## Summary
Environment has become a major concern recent years, and forest fires are one of the serious environment issues. In this project,data about forest fires in Portugal are analyzed. Numerical predictor variabless uchas tempurature, rain, wind speed and categorical variables such as month and day are included in this dataset, and are used to predict the burned area of the forest in a wildfire. 

To achieve our goal, after preprocessing the data, we fit four models including smoothing spline, random forest, gradient boosting and generalized linear model based on the given data. In model selection part, we try to provide evidence why or why not the model is a good fit and select the best candidate in conclusion.
